# Express Homework

##Objective
Build an Express API that responds to GET and POST requests. The API should return appropriate responses for each request.

##Step-by-Step Guide
###Project Initialization:

Create a new folder and initialize a Node.js project with npm init -y.
Install Express using the command npm install express.


##Setting Up the Express Server:
Create a file for your server, such as server.js.
In server.js, set up a basic Express server.

##Creating Express Routes:

Define a GET route in your Express server that returns a JSON response.
Define a POST route in your Express server that accepts JSON data and returns a confirmation message.

##Testing the Server:
Use tools like Postman or ThunderClient to test the GET and POST routes.
Ensure that your server correctly handles requests and returns appropriate responses.

##Document Your Code:
Add comments to your server.js file to explain your code and logic.
Implement localStorage in your Express API to store and retrieve data between requests.

##Deliverables
Submit the following:

Your project folder containing the server.js file and any other relevant files.
A brief document explaining your approach and any challenges you faced.
